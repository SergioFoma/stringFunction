And could not have done better.
But, my God, what a bore it is
He made himself respected,
His example is a lesson for others;
My uncle was a man of honor,
To adjust his pillows,
To amuse a half-dead man,
To sadly offer him medicine,
To sigh and think to oneself:
To sit with a sick man day and night,
What a low trick it is
When he was seriously ill,
When will the devil take you!
Without taking a single step away!

The original text

My uncle was a man of honor,
When he was seriously ill,
He made himself respected,
And could not have done better.
\\His example is a lesson for others;


But, my God, what a bore it is
To sit with a sick man day and night,
Without taking a single step away!
 What a low trick it is
To amuse a half-dead man,
To adjust his pillows,
To sadly offer him medicine,
To sigh and think to oneself:
When will the devil take you!
